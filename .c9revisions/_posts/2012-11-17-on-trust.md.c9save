Trusting your instincts is extremely important - sometimes they're wrong, \nbut most of the time they aren't.\n\n## If you feel deep down that you can entrust your life to a person, trust your own judgement.\n\nSounds ludicrous right? But really, if you don’t think you can rely on your own [seemingly rash] judgement, how do you feel comfortable trusting anyone else’s judgement? It makes no sense. In the last 6 months or so I’ve rapidly become a much more confident person, much of this I attribute to trusting myself; there are more instances than I care to mention where I’ve acted upon someone else’s advice (in the past) in spite of my gut feeling being different, only to realise months (or years) later that I was right.\n\n# Trust yourself, take risks and own your failures\n\nSounds obvious and silly to the initiated, but I wish I had the sense to realise this a long time ago."]],"start1":90,"start2":90,"length1":8,"length2":1506}]],"length":1596,"saved":false}
