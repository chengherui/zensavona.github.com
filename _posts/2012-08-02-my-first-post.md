### Ideas

### On Matches
- make all things lead to real world interaction. or skype chatting. Real time interaction rather than bullshit message based stuff.
- match people by social class and only let people see other people they 'would like'
- call it something along the lines of **meet cool people** and remove the stigma of dating sites as much as possible.
>You know that cool guy you know (Shyam)? Meet more people like him here.

### On Layout
- fun to use, easy, mobile app, clean design. Help the user in every way.

### On General functionality
- let the site suggest everything and let the user correct it as they please (people are indecisive, give them a starting point)
>"meet up at 7pm on friday, does this suit?"

- allow you to chat with anyone on their phone app in the general vicinity, and allow you to "buzz" them and alert them to your presence (e.g. if you see a hot girl and want to start a conversation) **but be sure to make the user very aware of the fact that their presence is public**

### Potential names
- mermeet
- coolerthanme
- boom.com
